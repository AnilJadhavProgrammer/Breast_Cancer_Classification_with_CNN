**Breast Cancer Classification Using CNN**

**Overview**

This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify breast cancer images. The model is trained to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors using histopathological images. The project is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project contains histopathological images of breast cancer, which are labeled as benign or malignant. The dataset can be sourced from Kaggle.

**Project Structure**

"Breast_Cancer_Classification_with_CNN.ipynb": Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
'README.md': This file, providing an overview and instructions.
Installation
To run the notebook, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

**pandas, 
numpy, 
matplotlib, 
seaborn, 
tensorflow, 
keras**

You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tensorflow keras

**Usage**

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the same directory as the notebook.
2. **Run the Notebook**: Open and run the Breast_Cancer_Classification_with_CNN.ipynb notebook to preprocess the data, build the CNN model, train it, and evaluate its performance.
3. **Model Evaluation** : Evaluates the model on the test data and visualizes performance metrics.
